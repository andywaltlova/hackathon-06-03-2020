# Czechitas data hackathon
(data from Thermofisher Scientific, not included in repository)


The goal of the hackathon was to process data from Thermofisher Scientific. 

The data provided consisted of nine csv files, each with approximately 500,000 - 1,200,000 records. Each csv file represented a log of events of one electron microscope. 

The aim was to find correlations in the data and to suggest to the company some optimization of the operation of microscopes.
